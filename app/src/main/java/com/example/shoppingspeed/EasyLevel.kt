/*
I could have a array of all items in store.
make a random list using those values.

using rows and columns I can make a grid pattern for store item placements
I can use image command to set pngs as images for each item.

I will have to figure out timer
I can have item list on the top and have item turn green when user clicks on item.
    - I will need to figure out SavedStates
